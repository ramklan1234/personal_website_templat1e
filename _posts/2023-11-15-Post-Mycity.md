- Actually, I was born in Maragheh. Maragheh is one of the cities in 
- the East Azerbaijan province.The population of Maragheh is about 
- 250000 .It is nearly a big city.The weather of the Maragheh is so   
- nice ,although it is cold in the winter.You should know that the Sahand peak is near to 
- Maragheh and it is one the tallest mountains in the Iran. Sahand has so beautiful views and
- it is full of flowers(especially Fritillaria).Most of the year Sahand is full of snows
- This feature helps to the farmers to irrigate their farms during the summer.Maragheh is also
- a historical city.During the govenmentof "Hellakukhan",Maragheh was the capital of Iran.
- Since that time, Maragheh is famous for it's observatory.
